This is a mock to demonstrate the launch of application via [SMART Launch](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/)

It is based on [BMI healthy weight calculator](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/) and is showing:
- The application can be started with parameters which allow the app to access existing patient data in an EPR
- The calculated BMI value can be written back
